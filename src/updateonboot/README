This script yum update on boot.  This allows machines that have been turned
off for an extended amount of time to become secure immediately, instead of
waiting until the next early morning cron job.

To install this, copy yum-updateonboot.init to /etc/init.d/yum-updateonboot
and copy yum-updateonboot.sysconfig to /etc/sysconfig/yum-updateonboot
After copying the files, run: /sbin/chkconfig --add yum-updateonboot

There are a couple of configuration options in /etc/sysconfig/yum-updateonboot

REBOOT_RPMS - any rpms listed in this variable will have their version and
              release numbers checked before and after the updates.  If there
	      is any change in those numbers, or in the number of installed
	      packages with that name, the init script will immediately reboot
	      the system.  This is intended to catch kernel updates and
	      immediately boot into the new kernel, instead of having to later
	      schedule a downtime to do it.

GROUPLIST -   This is a list of groups that the init script will call
              'yum groupupdate' on (its called after the 'yum update' and
	      before the last check of rpm versions for REBOOT_RPMS).  This
	      way you will also install any updates to yum groups that you
	      may have in your local repositories.
