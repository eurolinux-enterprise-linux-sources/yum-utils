This is refresh-updatesd, a plugin for Yum.

refresh-updatesd tells yum-updatesd to check for updates when yum exits. This
way, if you run 'yum update' and install all available updates, puplet will
almost instantly update itself to reflect this.

The plugin is very dumb, It should probably send a message when yum detects
updated packages as well.
