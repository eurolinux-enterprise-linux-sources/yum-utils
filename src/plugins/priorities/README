priorities
----------

* Introduction *

This plugins is inspired by the protectbase plugin, and enables/disables
packages based on a repository priority.

* Enabling the plugin *

You can install this plugin by copying it to /usr/lib/yum-plugins. To
enable this plugin, make sure that you have 'plugins=1' in /etc/yum.conf,
and create the file /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/priorities.conf with the
following content:

[main]
enabled=1

If you also want the plugin to protect high-priority repositories against
obsoletes in low-priority repositories, enable the 'check_obsoletes' bool:

check_obsoletes=1

By default, this plugin excludes packages from lower priority repositories
based on the package name. If you want to exclude packages based ony the
package name and architecture, enable the 'only_samearch' bool:

only_samearch=N

You can also temporarily enable this option with the '--samearch-priorities'
command-line option.

* Setting repository priorities *

You can add priorities to repositories by adding the line:

priority=N

to the repository entry, where N is an integer number. The default
priority for repositories is 99. The repositories with the lowest
number have the highest priority.
